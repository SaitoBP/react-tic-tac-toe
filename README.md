# React Tic Tac Toe

Just a basic version of tic-tac-toe created using react, this project was intended as a study case for making things in react other than only simple web apps

## Testing

Testing was done using cypress, using the concept of E2E (End-To-End)

To run tests use

```
yarn test
```

For now only the win mechanic is being tested, more tests need to be added

## Future Improvements

- ~~Add automatic testing with cypress~~
- ~~Stop game when someone wins~~
- Create a starting screen
- Add multiplayer mode with web sockets
- ~~Improve styles and animations~~
- Add a bot for single player mode
- Show how the player win
